# Source provenance

## Normative inputs

The signature contract and fixtures are copied byte-for-byte from the
manifest-bound Round-4 source tree observed on 2026-08-15. Their portable
hashes are recorded in `inputs/round4/SHA256SUMS`.

The copied Round-4 source manifest has SHA-256
`bea39d24dd5f952d715c3cdd3db5c163a95cdb4645128b046e88d4c2db226da2`.
The Round-4 review recommendation and later execution logs are intentionally
not implementation inputs and are not included in this source tree.

## Reused Rust primitives

The implementation reused or consulted the following paths in commit
`2d0375b92292e37bf34ec595751671cb38fa483c` of the local
`ed301-openssl-provider` repository:

The original Ed301-EdDSA candidate removed the donor repository's historical
X301 helpers and narrowed its interfaces for draft-00. The current X301 module
is a later additive implementation with the separate provenance recorded
below. The scalar, transcript and signature layers adapt implementation
patterns but rewrite the incompatible byte-contract semantics; the historical
signature semantics are not reused. The Valgrind client is test-only and
remains outside the public crate's safe Rust boundary. The square-root
exponentiation delegates to the bounded,
constant-schedule Montgomery exponentiation supplied by the same pinned
`crypto-bigint 0.7.5` dependency; the project-specific 76-byte scalar reducer
remains explicit.

The Git blob identifiers and SHA-256 values above preserve the exact origin
mapping without making the historical repository part of this source tree.

## Vendored AArch64 detector patch

`cpufeatures 0.3.0` used an any-bit test for composite Linux/Android HWCAP
masks. The local patch requires every bit implied by Rust's `aes`, `sha2`,
`sha3`, and `sm4` target features. The upstream checksum-map SHA-256 and exact
change are recorded in `vendor/cpufeatures/ED301_PATCHES.md`; the crate version,
license, and registry package checksum are unchanged.

## X301 and hybrid sources

X301 was implemented additively from the frozen ED301 parameters, the RFC
7748 ladder and birational-map pattern, and the OpenSSL provider contracts
listed in `docs/X301_DRAFT.md`. It reuses the existing 5x64 field backend; no
X301 arithmetic source was imported from the historical donor repository.
The independent Python implementation under `reference/x301/` is test-only
and is not linked into the product.

X301MLKEM1024 follows the published TLS hybrid construction named in
`docs/X301_DRAFT.md`. ML-KEM-1024 is fetched through EVP in the provider child
library context, whose provider/property policy selects the implementation.
This repository contains no ML-KEM implementation, copied ML-KEM subroutine,
hybrid KDF or standalone hybrid encoding.

The complete preserved curve-selection package is published under
`evidence/curve-provenance/`. Its original manifest covers the search tools,
355 worker results, transcript, point-count/security tools, certificates,
verifiers and outputs. This is after-the-fact provenance, not a pre-search
public commitment or independent review.

## Safe-Rust performance repair input

The 2026-08-24 Safe-Rust MAC-fold and public-import wNAF changes were reviewed
from `ED301_EDDSA_PERFORMANCE_ROUND2_CLAUDE_RESPONSE_2026-08-24.zip`, SHA-256
`778557578b615e902753fe1e18227d4d7ecdd45b8b8f0d2148c2bccca3b8129c`.
Its combined prototype diff has SHA-256
`bd0f84f0dbc361ea046c49186ba1cbd2fdb84e04169efa9e344871d204aa518e`.

The response archive's outer manifest and patch bytes verified, but its nested
integrated source carried the unchanged parent `SOURCE_MANIFEST.sha256` and a
host-absolute sidecar. The nested source archive was therefore not adopted as
an authenticated checkpoint. The three code changes were instead applied to
the current authoritative worktree, compared byte-for-byte with the proposed
tree, documented here and placed behind a newly generated local source
manifest before authoritative gates.

The imported ideas change only the portable field reduction schedule and the
public external-key subgroup schedule. The BMI2 spike, architecture
intrinsics, runtime CPU dispatch and its proposed unsafe boundary were not
imported. The public cryptographic crate retains `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.

## Freeze boundary

Published checkpoints are identified by their Git commit and by
`SOURCE_MANIFEST.sha256`.  Review results apply only to the exact source
identity recorded with those results.

## Experimental provider donor

The provider experiment was reconstructed from the source-only portion of
`ED301_EDDSA_DRAFT00_PROVIDER_FABLE_PRE100_RESULT_20260818.zip`, SHA-256
`3547ee9f5e59dbe223e3c621132069afce61ee34c92895f164af8a5df1e9a5d2`.
Its internal content manifest was verified before any file was consulted.

Imported relationships:

| repository path | donor relationship |
|---|---|
| `provider/crates/x301-provider/` | X301 provider Rust/C source |
| `provider-tests/x301/` | X301 EVP, hybrid, TLS and fuzz harnesses |
| `scripts/provider-profile-guard.sh` | adapted profile-observation helper |
| `scripts/build-openssl-provider-lane.sh` | adapted public-release builder |

Old compiled modules, harness binaries, result logs and PASS receipts were not
imported.  The repository version binds the provider directly to the current
local `ed301-eddsa` crate, uses the repository's vendored dependencies,
generates fixtures from `inputs/round4/`, replaces the donor orchestrator,
and records fresh local evidence.  The donor is design and source provenance,
not an independent security review.

## Provider repair references

The 2026-08-22 integration repair consulted the public OpenSSL 3.5.7 release
source for provider-facing interface patterns:

| OpenSSL path | relationship | source SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| `providers/legacyprov.c` | child `OSSL_LIB_CTX` and Core error-mark dispatch pattern | `59ba86bced50be12994c366e1d9805011da60ba0601ed320d3dee600f7aa9add` |
| `test/testutil/fake_random.c` | minimal test-only RAND dispatch shape | `33298fb660c10c89d486d2ffd5845512b845bd64914e3b0644061fd15a14e0fc` |

The implementation is not a copy of either provider. It narrows those public
Apache-2.0 interface patterns to the Ed301 child-context and deterministic
RAND regression tests.
