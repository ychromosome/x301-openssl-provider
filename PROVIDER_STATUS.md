# Provider status

The ordinary Ed301-EdDSA module is an experimental, signature-only OpenSSL
provider for `Ed301-EdDSA-draft-00`. X301 and X301MLKEM1024 are separate
additive provider surfaces documented in `docs/X301_DRAFT.md` and
`docs/X301_EXTENDED_ASSURANCE.md`.

The provider and its evidence boundary were repaired on 2026-08-23 after an
18-finding deep scan. The 2026-08-24 performance-review revision keeps the
same acceptance boundary: only fresh exact-revision builds against OpenSSL
3.5.7 and 4.0.1 support a reviewer handoff. The matrix covers:

- provider loading/unloading and parallel host-owned test registration;
- `KEYMGMT`, `SIGNATURE`, EVP key generation, signing and verification;
- the four positive vectors, edge matrices and 77 negative mutations;
- PKCS#8, SPKI, CSR, CA/leaf certificates and chain validation;
- TLS 1.3 server authentication and mutual TLS with a private-use test
  SignatureScheme;
- negative digest, context, streaming, parser, collision and malformed-input
  cases;
- targeted ASan/UBSan, Valgrind, GCC analyzer and allocation-failure gates.

Before any Cargo command, the provider runner requires a read-only,
caller-authenticated source snapshot. It verifies the complete regular-file
and directory inventory, rejects extra source, symlinks and special files,
and re-verifies the snapshot after the matrix. Cargo runs from `/` with an
explicit repository configuration, a minimal environment, canonical tools,
private homes and targets, and complete per-invocation profile receipts.
Generated files, modules and executable harnesses are sealed before first
execution and checked again afterward.

The repaired integration boundary is:

- key generation obtains its 38-byte seed from `RAND_priv_bytes_ex()` in a
  provider child `OSSL_LIB_CTX`; a host-selected deterministic RAND and a
  forced RAND failure are both covered by regression tests;
- the ordinary module has no OID alias and performs no OID/SIGID mutation.
  Optional PKI/TLS setup is serialized and verified by the host harness
  against its own `libcrypto` registry before loading the test artifact;
- one module is compiled per OpenSSL ABI major. Major 3 requires 3.5 or later;
  major 4 requires 4.0 or later. Patch equality is not required;
- repeated DigestSign/DigestVerify initialization with a NULL key retains the
  already bound immutable key snapshot, matching OpenSSL's Ed25519 lifecycle;
  invalid modes are rejected before touching that retained snapshot, whereas
  an invoked callback failure or a rejected reinitialization carrying a new
  key clears the old operation fail-closed;
  malformed signatures remain ordinary zero-valued non-matches while invalid
  state and pointer/length contracts return a negative operational error;
- the ordinary and PKI artifacts expose no decoder. Supported private-key
  imports use the exact, complete-buffer host parser. The TLS-only artifact
  has one fixed-size SPKI decoder for peer certificates: it refuses partial
  input before reading and rewinds every pre-OID mismatch. Optional fixed PKI
  encoders remain confined to separately named test artifacts; and
- the ordinary provider has no `TLS-SIGALG` dispatch. The private-use TLS
  proof and a second full Ed301 collision provider are separately named,
  disabled-by-default test artifacts.

The optional PKI tests use project-assigned OID
`1.3.6.1.4.1.66282.301.3` beneath the Adiumentum GmbH private-enterprise arc.
It identifies the exact Ed301-EdDSA key/signature profile but is not an IANA
TLS registration or a standards claim. Private-use TLS SignatureScheme
`0xFE84` appears only in the TLS test artifacts and remains nonregistrable and
unsuitable for deployment.

The ordinary provider keeps expanded secret state and the validated public
verification table in separate, immutable, fallibly allocated reference-counted
objects. Signature contexts and context duplicates retain only the object they
need instead of copying roughly 10 KiB of prepared state. A public-only key
duplicate cannot retain the expanded signing secret, and each object is
destroyed only after its final owner releases it. The default signing path
follows the usual EdDSA construction without performing a second complete
verification of its own output; a separately selected `sign-self-verify` build
retains that additional fault-detection check. Neither choice changes the draft
transcript, wire encoding, curve, verification equation, or acceptance
language.

The integrated Safe-Rust performance step replaces the portable field
reducer's borrow-heavy folding schedule with a positive
multiply-accumulate fold and reuses the already required public
odd-multiples table for external-key subgroup validation. The latter follows
a fixed public width-8 wNAF encoding of `L` with 299 doublings and 17 mixed
additions; the previous sparse 299-doubling/63-addition implementation remains
a differential reference. Both changes preserve the curve, transcript, byte
contract, canonicality and factor-4 verification language. The public core
continues to forbid unsafe code. The experimental BMI2 backend was
deliberately not integrated.

The scalar-reduction follow-up removes the generic base-`2^64` Horner loop.
Pruned 304-bit scalars now use one existing Montgomery conversion; each
608-bit hash output is split into its natural two 304-bit halves and combined
with the fixed public radix `2^304 mod L`. Wide division remains test-only.
The radix literal was reproduced independently with Python integers and Perl
Math::BigInt, while the division oracle covers named `L`/`2L`/maximum-half
boundaries, byte 37/38, all 608 one-hot inputs and 10,000 deterministic full-
width values. A CPU-4-pinned core ABBA comparison observed the isolated
reducer at about 158 instead of 803 nanoseconds, with prepared signing about
3.4% and prepared verification about 1.2% faster. The final 304+304 secret
path also passed all four defined/tainted public/sign Valgrind lanes; its
release disassembly contains fixed-loop control only in the Montgomery kernel
and no conditional branch in the reducer's secret recombination. These are
local development measurements and checks, not a portable performance or
constant-time proof.

The current Fedora Rust toolchain also makes its safe runtime
`u64::borrowing_sub` operation a useful replacement for the field backend's
larger Hacker's-Delight borrow expansion. The explicit bitwise helper remains
only in the compile-time table path because the standard operation is not yet
stable in const evaluation. The runtime path remains Safe Rust and retains the
final `CtAssign` selection boundary. This change is accepted for its concrete
code-size and measured end-to-end benefit, not merely because a newer API is
available; its compiler-specific branchlessness is rechecked in the final
provider modules and secret-taint lane. The API was stabilized in Rust 1.91;
the manifests declare that version as the minimum build toolchain while the
canonical gates continue to use the current Fedora stable compiler. This
declaration is not a portable constant-time claim: every compiler and final
artifact must repeat the codegen and taint gates.

This compiler-sensitive choice is enforced at the final artifact rather than
only in an isolated Rust probe. Each OpenSSL-lane run disassembles its actual
Thin-LTO ordinary provider, checks the named reducer, point-operation,
scalar-reduction and table-selection symbols for the reviewed SBB/CMOV shape
and absence of conditional jumps, and applies a same-binary negative control
to the checker. A separately built instrumented ordinary module then taints
the seed before `EVP_PKEY_fromdata` and exercises public-key derivation and
deterministic signing through EVP, the C shim, Rust FFI and core under
Valgrind. These results remain specific to the recorded compiler, profile,
architecture and exercised paths;
`docs/ARITHMETIC_IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTER.md` records the mandatory re-review
on every toolchain change.

The provider's local `Shared<T>` owner and `try_box` allocation helper exist
because stable Rust still lacks fallible `Arc` and `Box` construction. Their
replacement triggers and required lifecycle evidence are recorded separately
in `docs/PROVIDER_IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTER.md`.

Five CPU-2-pinned local runs on this development host observed the following
medians after the first low-risk performance repairs and before the subsequent
MAC-fold/wNAF step:

| OpenSSL | Prepared sign | Prepared verify | Seed import | Public import |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3.5.7 | 39.245 us | 127.492 us | 77.488 us | 164.490 us |
| 4.0.1 | 39.291 us | 128.139 us | 77.198 us | 164.120 us |

Five CPU-15-pinned exact-revision EVP runs after the MAC-fold/wNAF integration
observed these medians:

| OpenSSL | Prepared sign | Prepared verify | Seed import | Public import |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3.5.7 | 35.447 us | 108.664 us | 67.820 us | 123.954 us |
| 4.0.1 | 35.291 us | 108.773 us | 67.657 us | 124.146 us |

Relative to the immediately preceding table, prepared signing improved by
about 10%, prepared verification by about 15%, seed import by about 12%, and
public import by about 24--25%. On the same runs the Ed25519/Ed448 prepared
midpoints were approximately 84 microseconds for signing and 115 microseconds
for verification, so Ed301 is faster than the stated midpoint target on this
host. These measurements remain development evidence, not a portable
performance guarantee.

The exact parent revision measured 287.826/286.317 microseconds for seed
import and 248.430/248.421 microseconds for public import on the two lanes.
The repairs therefore reduce those medians by about 73% and 34% respectively,
while prepared sign and verify remain within roughly 1% of the parent, as
expected. Historical paired figures of 31--33/93--95 microseconds came from a
rejected build in which the compiler had introduced a secret-dependent
field-reduction branch; that pair remains invalid evidence.

After the final two-lane provider, secret-taint and code-generation gates, five
independent CPU-0-pinned processes per lane measured the fixed 24-byte KAT as
follows. Each entry is the median of five batch means with at least 250 ms per
operation, not an isolated single-call latency:

| OpenSSL | Algorithm | Prepared sign | Prepared verify |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 3.5.7 | Ed25519 | 22.983 us | 77.007 us |
| 3.5.7 | Ed301 | 31.909 us | 100.687 us |
| 3.5.7 | Ed448 | 144.380 us | 154.112 us |
| 4.0.1 | Ed25519 | 22.752 us | 76.541 us |
| 4.0.1 | Ed301 | 31.918 us | 100.578 us |
| 4.0.1 | Ed448 | 145.010 us | 153.695 us |

The safe final Ed301 signing value therefore independently returns to roughly
32 microseconds, but final verification is roughly 101 rather than the
rejected 93--95 microseconds. On this host Ed301 signing is about 39--40%
slower than Ed25519 and about 4.5 times faster than Ed448; verification is
about 31% slower than Ed25519 and about 35% faster than Ed448.

A separate three-process, CPU-2-pinned rotation gave each of the four positive
KATs equal weight and retained independent prepared contexts per KAT:

| OpenSSL | Equal-weight prepared sign | Equal-weight prepared verify |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 3.5.7 | 35.906 us | 102.667 us |
| 4.0.1 | 35.819 us | 102.609 us |

The short-message repetition differed from the five-process result by at most
0.84%. The aggregate signing increase is accounted for by the 4096-byte KAT's
additional SHAKE work; three distinct keys showed no key-specific regression.
Both benchmark sets are comparative development evidence on one Ryzen 5950X
x86-64 host, not portable performance guarantees or acceptance gates.

Symbol profiles found the wide scalar reducer and field inversion at only
single-digit percentages of the measured signing and import paths. A measured
fixed-`p-2` inversion prototype regressed prepared signing from about 39 to 48
microseconds and seed import from about 77 to 95 microseconds, so it was
discarded. A lazy verification table remains workload-dependent and was not
added: it would shift rather than remove work and would introduce first-use
synchronization. The accepted positive field fold is portable Safe Rust; no
assembly, architecture intrinsic, native-CPU flag, secret-indexed table or new
arithmetic unsafe boundary is part of this revision. The provider's manual
shared-state owner remains inside the existing native FFI unsafe boundary.

Local pre-push gates completed on 2026-08-25 include the complete provider
matrix against OpenSSL 3.5.7 and 4.0.1 under Rust 1.97.1 and the secret-taint
and final-provider code-generation lanes. A complete security diff review of
all 16 source-like post-Package-B changes found no reportable candidate; it is
not the deferred full-repository deep scan. A pre-`borrowing_sub` revision also
passed an offline Rust-1.85.1 lane
with format/lint, core tests, provider units and loaded OpenSSL 3.5.7
load/key-management/signature harnesses. That one-time result remains useful
historical compatibility evidence, but is not an MSRV, support promise or
future release gate. These local results do not replace independent
reproduction. Open gates include the fresh full-scope Deep Security Scan,
AArch64, coverage-guided fuzzing, QEMU/container lanes, final zeroization
review, and an external TLS SignatureScheme allocation. No production,
standardization or release claim is made.
